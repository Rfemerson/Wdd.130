      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        My journey in technology started as a child, I was always interested in innovative things that could optimize or make my life easier, as a teenager I was sure I wanted to be able to build things and for a moment I thought about being a civil engineer, when I was approved at the Federal University from Ceará, I dedicated myself to knowing and learning more about software development and related areas and the result was a passion for technology and its areas of activity. Today I work as a software developer at a startup that has a web and mobile application for managing working hours, there I dedicate myself to developing automated tests to correct errors before the user uses the system, I am also responsible for correcting small errors in the bank data so that the user has the best experience possible. I believe that technology is a powerful tool that can make people's lives better, from small acts such as facilitating communication to complex surgeries performed by programmed robots.
        What I like most about being a developer is being able to turn an idea into a reality that will help a person, whether in their business or in their personal life. In my spare time, I like to spend time with my wife. What we like to do most is go out to see new places, and we also

        <!-- My most recent project was the creation of a website for a Rafting club, I felt challenged because I didn't know the sport and its particularities, but by researching more about this sport I was able to make a dynamic website, optimized and easy to use so that they can be read quickly by browsers and clients. Another project is a website where I will expose the places and restaurants that my wife and I like the most, I intend to help young couples to choose where they will go on their dates and where they can find sharing and good food. -->
