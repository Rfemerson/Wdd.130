                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My journey in technology started as a child, I was always interested in innovative things that could optimize or make my life easier,
                    as a teenager I was sure I wanted to be able to build things and for a moment I thought about being a civil engineer, when I was approved 
                    at the Federal University from Ceará, I dedicated myself to knowing and learning more about software development and related areas 
                    and the result was a passion for technology and its areas of activity.
                    <br><br> 
                    Today I work as a software developer at a startup that has a web and
                    mobile application for managing working hours, there I dedicate myself to developing automated tests to correct errors before the user uses
                    the system, I am also responsible for correcting small errors in the bank data so that the user has the best experience possible. 
                    <br><br>
                    I believe that technology is a powerful tool that can make people's lives better, from small acts such as facilitating communication to complex
                    surgeries performed by programmed robots. What I like most about being a developer is being able to turn an idea into a reality that will help a person,
                    whether in their business or in their personal life. In my spare time, I like to spend time with my wife. What we like to do most is go out to see new places,
                    and we also</p>
